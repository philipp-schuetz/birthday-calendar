"""modules receives an input method and a filename and returns the validated input data if it exists"""

# is it maybe possible to implement the different versions of input reading with oop interfaces,
# what would be the most pythonic way to do this
# oop is an interesting thing in general, when it comes to developing in python
#
# i it is possible for me to do this usig interfaces, I could to one definition and implement this for each input method
# the input method/implementation to use is handled and managed by the input_handler.py
# data validation is already with the person type
# can I enforce data and throw errors, if there is no data?
